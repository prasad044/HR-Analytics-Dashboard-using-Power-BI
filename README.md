# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-BI

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an HR analytics dashboard that will assist a company in increasing employee performance and decreasing attrition. Utilizing the dashboard's insightful employee data will help you make data-driven decisions and increase staff retention and happiness.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The data was prepared for analysis through a number of stages. Duplicate values were removed along with null values. The right data types were assigned, and spelling mistakes were found and fixed. In addition, a conditional column for the attrition count was added. This conditional column used the attrition column to assign a value of 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no." In addition, a new metric was developed to determine the attrition rate, which was obtained by dividing the entire number of attritions by the total number of employees.
