## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an HR analytics dashboard that will assist a company in increasing employee performance and decreasing attrition. Utilizing the dashboard's insightful employee data will help you make data-driven decisions and increase staff retention and happiness.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The data was prepared for analysis through a number of stages. Duplicate values were removed along with null values. The right data types were assigned, and spelling mistakes were found and fixed. In addition, a conditional column for the attrition count was added. This conditional column used the attrition column to assign a value of 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no." In addition, a new metric was developed to determine the attrition rate, which was obtained by dividing the entire number of attritions by the total number of employees.

## Key Performance Indicatiors(KPI's): 
The key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and monitor employee performance and attrition have been identified in order to begin the analysis. Card visualizations in Power BI were used to construct the following KPIs:

- Employee Count
- Attrition
- Attrition rate
- Average age
- Average Monthly income
- Average Age

## Charts: 
To learn more about the employee data, I created a number of charts and visualizations. Several important findings were made as a result of the analysis: as follows:

1) Donut Chart: The attrition count by educational field was shown on the chart. According to the data, the field with the highest attrition rate was the life sciences, with 38% of employees quitting, followed by the medical area with 27%.
2) Stacked column Chart: The chart showed the attrition count by age group. The data revealed that the age group from 26-35 had the highest attrition count of 116.
3) Matrix Table Chart: The large numbers were highlighted in grey in the chart that ranked job positions according to job satisfaction ratings. According to the data, research scientists and sales executives had the lowest attrition rates, while laboratory technicians had the highest.
4) Stacked bar chart: The chart showed the top 4 job roles with the highest attrition count. The data showed that laboratory technicians had the highest attrition count of 62, followed by sales executives and research scientists.
5) Area chart: The attrition count inside the company was shown graphically by year. The statistics indicated that the largest an increase occurred after the employee completed their first year of employment, followed by ten, and finally five years.

## Filters:
In the end, department filters were added to the dashboard's top, enabling users to select a department to filter the entire screen.

## Conclusion: 
Important employee data was shown on an HR analytics dashboard, which can help in better decision-making and maintain employee satisfaction and efficiency. The HR division may assist staff members in performing better and holding onto their employment longer by addressing concerns that they encounter and promoting a happy work environment. This could lead to more revenue and success for the organization.
